Notes

1. Tensorflow.js cocoSSD model is used in this project. We can also train a model ourselves and 
use it for object detection.(I have trained a model in keras to guess the user designed doodles. I 
converted this model to tensorflow.js and used it on the website. https://aniketdogra.github.io/doodler)

2. The website prediction is slow for 1st image as the model is being loaded and the model is big. After 
that subsequent predictions are very fast.

3. Enable caching for better performance or else the model will download everytime you make a prediction(I 
am working on this.)

4. The bounding box data is currently being outputed to the console. If required this data can be shown on 
the website.
