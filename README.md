# caMicroscope CODE CHALLENGE
### Interest Extraction
**TASK** : Using a machine learning toolkit of your choice, create a tool which identifies objects in the image, then returns positions in pixels corresponding to bounding boxes of a user-selected class of object in the image.

**Technology Used** : Javascript, Tensorflow.js


### How to use

1. Download the Repository
2. Open Index.html
3. Upload Image using upload button
4. Type the class of the image you want to detect. See the supported classes in classes.txt
5. On clicking the predict button the model will create bounding boxes around the class typed by the user.(If the class is present in the image)
6. *Download button will create a zip file of all the objects detected and will be downloaded to your computer.
7. Clear button clears the canvas.

*Added after feedback from mentor.
